- Ensure compliance with industry standards (e.g., ASME, AWS).
- Perform failure analysis and quality control.

### 2. **Aerospace Welder**
Aerospace welders perform the actual welding of metal parts used in the manufacturing or repair of aircraft and spacecraft. They often work with advanced materials such as titanium, aluminum, and high-strength steel alloys.

#### Responsibilities:
- Perform welding on airframes, engines, and other components.
- Use various welding techniques (e.g., TIG, MIG, Plasma Arc) depending on the material and application.
- Ensure that welds are precise, strong, and meet safety standards.
- Inspect and test welds for quality assurance.

### 3. **Welding Inspector**
Welding inspectors in aerospace are responsible for evaluating the quality of welds to ensure they meet all necessary specifications and safety standards. They use specialized tools and techniques to detect defects such as cracks or weaknesses in welds.

#### Responsibilities:
- Inspect welds for quality, precision, and structural integrity.
- Use non-destructive testing (NDT) methods like X-ray or ultrasonic testing.
- Provide reports on weld quality and recommend repairs or rework when needed.
- Ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations.
